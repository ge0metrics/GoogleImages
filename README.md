# GoogleImages
Search and download up to 100 images in full resolution from google images

# How to use (programmers)
* Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
  * beautifulsoup4
  * requests-html
* Download and extract this repository
* Move `GoogleImages.py` to your working directory
* Include in your code `from GoogleImages import GoogleImages` to import the script
* Instantiate the class with `gi=GoogleImages()` 
  * You can do `gi=GoogleImages(outputs=False)` if you would rather not see any output
* `gi.search("cat memes")` to start a search and load `gi` with the results
  * You can do `gi.search("cat memes",limit=5)` if you want to limit the search to only 5 results
  * It is limited to a maximum of 100, you cannot exceed this
* `gi.download()` to download the images to a folder that will be created by the script
  * Sometimes URLs are broken and the image cannot be downloaded from them
  * If `outputs=True`, you will be able to see when an image couldn't be downloaded
* `print(gi.images)` to see what images have been found
  * They are stored in URL format
  * It will be reset and overwritten every time a new search is performed
  
# How to use (everyone else)
* Assuming you just want to use this to download lots of images quickly
* Download and extract this repository
* Run `Downloader.exe`
* Type in your search query
* Set a limit, bearing in mind the maximum is 100
* Watch as your images are downloaded

# Extra notes (for everybody)
* All images will be saved as `.png` files UNLESS your query contains the word "gif", in which every result will be downloaded as a `.gif` file
* Due to the way this script works, very fast and repetitive access may make Google think you are attempting a DDOS and temporarily ban your IP address from making more requests, therefore it is advised you use this tool respectfully
